  /**
   * Large monorepos can become intimidating for newcomers if project folder paths don't follow
   * a consistent and recognizable pattern.  When the system allows nested folder trees,
   * we've found that teams will often use subfolders to create islands that isolate
   * their work from others ("shipping the org").  This hinders collaboration and code sharing.
   *
   * The Rush developers recommend a "category folder" model, where buildable project folders
   * must always be exactly two levels below the repo root.  The parent folder acts as the category.
   * This provides a basic facility for grouping related projects (e.g. "apps", "libraries",
   * "tools", "prototypes") while still encouraging teams to organize their projects into
   * a unified taxonomy.  Limiting to 2 levels seems very restrictive at first, but if you have
   * 20 categories and 20 projects in each category, this scheme can easily accommodate hundreds
   * of projects.  In practice, you will find that the folder hierarchy needs to be rebalanced
   * occasionally, but if that's painful, it's a warning sign that your development style may
   * discourage refactoring.  Reorganizing the categories should be an enlightening discussion
   * that brings people together, and maybe also identifies poor coding practices (e.g. file
   * references that reach into other project's folders without using Node.js module resolution).
   *
   * The defaults are projectFolderMinDepth=1 and projectFolderMaxDepth=2.
   *
   * To remove these restrictions, you could set projectFolderMinDepth=1
   * and set projectFolderMaxDepth to a large number.

     * If you merged or cherry-picked commits from the master branch into your PR branch, those commits

     * Rush needs to know where to find the base branch for your PR.  This information cannot be

     * of the Git remote indicated by the repository.url setting in rush.json.  If you are working in
