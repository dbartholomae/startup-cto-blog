     *
     * This feature protects against accidental inconsistencies that may be introduced
     * if the PNPM shrinkwrap file ("pnpm-lock.yaml") is manually edited.  When this
     * feature is enabled, "rush update" will append a hash to the file as a YAML comment,
     * and then "rush update" and "rush install" will validate the hash.  Note that this does not prohibit
     * manual modifications, but merely requires "rush update" be run
     * afterwards, ensuring that PNPM can report or repair any potential inconsistencies.
     *
     * To temporarily disable this validation when invoking "rush install", use the
     * "--bypass-policy" command-line parameter.
