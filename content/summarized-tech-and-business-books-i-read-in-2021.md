### Networking All-in-One For Dummies (by Doug Lowe)

At the beginning of the year I read up on tech fundamentals. One of the books I picked up, Networking All-in-One For Dummies, was a great and simple introduction to OSI layers, TCP/IP and Ethernet. Easy enough to be read even withoug much preknowledge, but deep enough so that I now feel comfortable explaining these topics to others. It is mostly about presentation, though, reading through the related Wikipedia articles might also work for you.

Recommended for anyone interested in networking basics.

### Liftoff: Launching Agile Teams & Projects (by Diana Larsen)

Right at the beginning of 2020, I helped to set up new product development teams at one of the companies I was working with. I remembered the benefit of explicit team norms from my time at McKinsey, and was looking for a book about the practicalities of starting up a team. Liftoff is a good introduction into the topic, though not as deep and extensive as I had hoped.

A good read for anyone starting a team.
